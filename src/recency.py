"""Older sales brought to today's prices, a window as long as the item needs,
and a resale price that owns up to how few sales it rests on.

Three things, all aimed at items that sell a hundred times a month rather than
a thousand, where a rung's top holds five sales in a fortnight:

Window by need. Sixteen days stays the window for any item that has a rung
with enough sales in it - liquid items are priced off fresh data exactly as
before. Only an item whose every rung falls short is read over 30 days, then
45.

Today's prices. A longer window on a falling market prices off last month:
$52.50 then, $51.50 now, and a median over both sits near $52 - paid for, and
never recovered. So the whole item's sales (far more of them than any rung
has) are made float-neutral the way `trend` does it - each divided by the
median of its own hundredth - and a line is drawn through them by age. Each
sale is then scaled by "level today / level on its day".

Asymmetric on purpose. Downward the line is followed in full: a fall taken
into account early costs at most a missed purchase. Upward it is capped by
what the last week actually traded at, and by five percent: a two-day spike
followed in full is a week-locked item bought at the top.

Then the median of a handful of sales is read with its error: the resale price
is the median less one standard error, which is a few cents at thirty sales
and half a dollar at five.
