"""Doppler phases: one market name on CSFloat, several skins underneath.

Steam and CSFloat sell every Doppler phase under one market_hash_name -
"★ Bayonet | Doppler (Factory New)" - and tell them apart only by the paint
index of the item: Phase 1 is 418, Ruby 415, and so on. A list that names the
phases separately ("★ Bayonet | Doppler Phase 1 (Factory New)") asks CSFloat
for a name it has never heard of and gets nothing back: 178 items read zero
sales for days.

So a phase name is turned into what CSFloat understands - the real name plus
`paint_index` - wherever a request is built, and whatever comes back is kept
only if its paint index is the phase's.
